[![Update MaxMind GeoLite2 DBs](https://github.com/MrUnknownDE/utools/actions/workflows/maxmind-update.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MrUnknownDE/utools/actions/workflows/maxmind-update.yml)



A modern web application that displays detailed information about a client's IP address, including geolocation, ASN, rDNS, and provides network diagnostic tools like Ping and Traceroute. It also allows looking up information for any public IP address.

### Livedemo: https://utools.johanneskr.de

## üöÄ Features

*   **Client IP Info:** Automatically detects and displays the visitor's public IP address.
*   **Geolocation:** Shows Country, Region, City, Postal Code, Coordinates, and Timezone based on the IP.
*   **ASN Information:** Displays the Autonomous System Number (ASN) and organization name.
*   **Reverse DNS (rDNS):** Performs a reverse DNS lookup for the IP address.
*   **Interactive Map:** Visualizes the geolocation on an OpenStreetMap.
*   **Traceroute:** Initiates a server-side traceroute (via SSE stream) to the client's IP (on click) or a looked-up IP.
*   **Ping:** Performs a server-side ping test to a looked-up IP.
*   **IP Lookup:** Allows users to enter any public IP address to retrieve its Geo, ASN, and rDNS information.
*   **Dockerized:** Both frontend and backend are containerized for easy deployment.
*   **Modern UI:** Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Deployment:**
    *   Docker & Docker Compose
    *   GitHub Actions (for CI/CD - building and pushing images to GHCR)

## üèÅ Getting Started

You can run this application easily using Docker and Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed (usually included with Docker Desktop)

### Option 1: Using Pre-built Images (Recommended)

This method uses the Docker images automatically built and pushed to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) by the GitHub Actions workflow.

1.  **Create `docker-compose.yml`:**
    Save the following content as `docker-compose.yml` in a new directory on your machine:

    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'

    services:
      backend:
        # Use the pre-built image from GHCR
        image: ghcr.io/mrunknownde/utools-backend:latest # Or specify a specific tag/sha
        container_name: utools_backend
        restart: unless-stopped
        environment:
          # Production environment settings
          NODE_ENV: production
          PORT: 3000
          LOG_LEVEL: info # Adjust log level if needed (e.g., 'debug', 'warn')
          PING_COUNT: 4
        dns:
          # Explicitly set reliable public DNS servers for rDNS lookups inside the container
          - 1.1.1.1    # Cloudflare DNS
          - 1.0.0.1    # Cloudflare DNS
          - 8.8.8.8    # Google DNS
          - 8.8.4.4    # Google DNS
        networks:
          - utools_network
        # Note: No ports exposed directly, access is via frontend proxy

      frontend:
        # Use the pre-built image from GHCR
        image: ghcr.io/mrunknownde/utools-frontend:latest # Or specify a specific tag/sha
        container_name: utools_frontend
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
          # Expose port 8080 on the host, mapping to port 80 in the container (Nginx)
          - "8080:80"
        depends_on:
          - backend # Ensures backend service is started first
        networks:
          - utools_network

    networks:
      utools_network:
        driver: bridge
        name: utools_network # Give the network a specific name
    ```

2.  **Start the Application:**
    Open a terminal in the directory where you saved the `docker-compose.yml` file and run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    This will download the images (if not already present) and start the containers in the background.

3.  **Access the Webapp:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

### Option 2: Building Images from Source

If you want to modify the code or build the images yourself:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mrunknownde/utools.git
    cd utools
    ```
2.  **Build and Start:**
    Use Docker Compose to build the images based on the `Dockerfile`s in the `backend` and `frontend` directories and then start the containers:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f compose.yml up -d --build
    ```
    *(Note: Ensure your `compose.yml` points to `build: ./backend` and `build: ./frontend` instead of `image: ...` if you modify the provided compose file)*

3.  **Access the Webapp:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The application is configured mainly through environment variables set in the `docker-compose.yml` file for the `backend` service:

*   `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production` for optimal performance and JSON logging.
*   `PORT`: The internal port the Node.js application listens on (default: `3000`).
*   `LOG_LEVEL`: Controls the logging verbosity (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`).
*   `PING_COUNT`: Number of ping packets to send (default: `4`).
*   `dns` (in compose): Specifies DNS servers for the backend container, crucial for reliable rDNS lookups.

The MaxMind database paths (`GEOIP_CITY_DB`, `GEOIP_ASN_DB`) are set within the backend's Dockerfile but could potentially be overridden if needed (e.g., using volumes).

## üåê Data Sources

*   **Geolocation & ASN:** This tool uses GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from [https://www.maxmind.com](https://www.maxmind.com).
    *   **Important:** The GeoLite2 databases require periodic updates. You need a MaxMind account (free) to download them. The Docker images contain the databases at build time. For long-term use, you should implement a process to update the `.mmdb` files within the `backend/data` directory (if using volumes) or rebuild the backend image regularly.
*   **Map Tiles:** Provided by OpenStreetMap contributors.
